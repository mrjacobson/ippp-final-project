# Crime and Parks
## How do parks affect crimes in major cities?
We were curious as to whether parks had any effect, positive or negative on
crime rates. It is possible that parks and open spaces could reduce crime,
following the idea that more open spaces means more people outside, and thus
lower crime rate due to more witnesses. It's also possible that the additional
park space could lead to increased crime for similar reasons. More people means
more potential victims. To that end, it's possible that crime could increase in
areas with more parks.
##Methodology
We collected data on crimes from five major cities, Chicago, New York City,
Philadelphia, Boston, and San Francisco. We also gathered geographical data
on these cities for their community areas or police districts. Initially we
mapped the amount of crime per area or district. Following Professor Saxon's
example from class we calculated the amount of park acreage and distance to the
nearest park for each of these cities. Based upon these initial findings, we
believed Chicago to be the most interesting case.
## A deeper look at Chicago
For Chicago we worked to identify the number of crimes per census tract, the
amount of park acreage per tract, and the distance to the nearest park. Once
we merged the appropriate data on the census tract level we performed some
basic statistical regression analysis to see if there was a relationship between
crime and parks. There was no statistically significant relationship. We also
incorporated several data points from the census and controlled for them in our
regressions. However, there was still very little relationship between crime
and parks. Given that we had the data loaded into the notebook already, we also
examined whether some of the census data had a relationship to the amount of
park acreage or the distance to the nearest park. These also showed no
significant relationship. It seems possible that the best explanation for park
area and placement are purely geographic, rather than related to the
demographical composition of an area.
